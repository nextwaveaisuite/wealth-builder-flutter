Wealth Builder is a rules-based, broker-agnostic micro-investing app for Australians. It automates $5–$25/week into a growth/safety ETF mix, keeps the portfolio on target, applies tiny capped “opportunity tilts,” protects with Loss Guard™ brakes, and exports buy/sell CSVs + deep links to Raiz, Spaceship, CommSec Pocket, Stockspot, and QuietGrowth.
