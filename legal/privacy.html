    <p>This policy explains how Wealth Builder™ (“we”, “us”) handles personal information under the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).</p>

    <h3>1. What we collect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Account</b>: name, email (if you create an account/subscribe).</li>
      <li><b>App telemetry</b>: anonymous counters (app opens, plan runs, tilts used).</li>
      <li><b>Billing</b>: subscription status and identifiers (processed by Stripe; we don’t see full card details).</li>
      <li><b>Support</b>: info you include when you contact us.</li>
      <li><b>Device data</b>: browser type, OS, IP (used for security/abuse prevention).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Why we collect it</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide, secure and improve the app and its features.</li>
      <li>To operate subscriptions and access control (via Stripe).</li>
      <li>To communicate about service updates, incidents and policy changes.</li>
      <li>To comply with law and manage risk, fraud and abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Cookies & local storage</h3>
    <p>We use essential cookies/local storage to keep you signed in and remember settings (e.g., “Buy the Dip” toggles). You can disable cookies in your browser but some features may not work.</p>

    <h3>4. Disclosures to third parties</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Stripe</b> (payments & PCI DSS compliance).</li>
      <li><b>Hosting/CDN</b> (Vercel/other cloud providers for secure delivery).</li>
      <li><b>Legal/Compliance</b> (if required by law or to protect rights, safety, security).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Overseas disclosure</h3>
    <p>Cloud providers may store/process data in locations outside Australia. We use reputable vendors with appropriate safeguards.</p>

    <h3>6. Security</h3>
    <p>We apply reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards. No method is 100% secure.</p>

    <h3>7. Access, correction & deletion</h3>
    <p>Contact us to access/correct your personal information. You may request deletion; we’ll retain what we must for legal or security reasons.</p>

    <h3>8. Data retention</h3>
    <p>Telemetry is aggregated and/or de-identified where possible. Billing records are retained per tax and accounting law.</p>
